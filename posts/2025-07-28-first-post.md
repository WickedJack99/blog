# My first blog post 👋🗺️

Yoo, Jack here, this is my first blog post to see the light.

Hello World 😊

On this blog I will post thoughts, and other stuff I want to share.

Huge thanks to [Emanuil Rusev](https://github.com/erusev) for developing Parsedown!

Code & structure inspired by OpenAI’s ChatGPT assistance.

See you later alligator!
